## Beginner React Project

### **Reusable Profile Cards App (Components & Props Only)**

---

## 👋 Introduction (Please Read 😊)

You are **new to React**, and that’s completely okay.

This project is designed to help you understand **the most important React concept**:

> 👉 **Components and Props**

You don’t need to worry about:

- State
- Hooks
- Events
- Logic

Just focus on **structure and reusability** 🌱

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a small React application that:

- Shows **multiple profile cards**
- Uses **one reusable component**
- Passes data using **props**

This is how **real React apps start**.

---

## 🛠 Technologies to Use

- React
- JSX
- CSS (basic)

You can use:

- Create React App **OR**
- Vite (preferred)

---

## 📌 What You Need to Build

### 1️⃣ Components Structure

You must create:

- `App.jsx`
- `ProfileCard.jsx`

---

### 2️⃣ ProfileCard Component

This component should accept **props** and display:

- Name
- Role
- Email

Example props (for understanding only):

```jsx
name;
role;
email;
```

💡 **Hint:**
Props are like function parameters.

---

### 3️⃣ App Component

- Import `ProfileCard`
- Use it **at least 3 times**
- Pass **different values** each time

💡 **Hint:**
Reuse is the main goal here.

---

### 4️⃣ UI Styling

- Simple card layout
- Name should be bold
- Cards should be aligned properly
- Clean spacing

💡 **Hint:**
Good UI is about **spacing**, not colors.

## 🧠 How to Think (Beginner Friendly)

If React feels confusing:

1. Think of components as **HTML blocks**
2. Props are just **data passed inside**
3. Same component, different data

That’s it 👍
